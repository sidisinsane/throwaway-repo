    <p>
      Oh, boy! No matter how much you try to imagine what this is like, it's just so <span class="text-fx-redacted">incredibly thrilling</span>, right down to your toes. I have a lot of <span class="text-fx-redacted">people</span> to <span class="text-fx-redacted">thank</span> and I'm going to be one of those people that tries to <span class="text-fx-redacted">mention</span> a lot of <span class="text-fx-redacted">names</span> because I know just two seconds ago my mother and father <span class="text-fx-redacted">went completely berserk</span> and I'd like to give some other mothers and fathers that opportunity.
      <br /><br />
      I'd like to <span class="text-fx-redacted">thank</span> William Styron for creating this beautiful <span class="text-fx-redacted">character</span> and Alan Pakula for bringing it to <span class="text-fx-redacted">the stage</span> and allowing me to <span class="text-fx-redacted">play</span> it. I would like to thank Marty Starger and ITC for finding the <span class="text-fx-redacted">financing</span> for it. Nestor Almendros, the great <span class="text-fx-redacted">cinematographer</span>[&hellip;]
