<p class="no-widows-no-orphans">
  Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent
  until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all
  the guarantees necessary for his defence. No one shall be held guilty of any
  penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a
  penal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was
  committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was
  applicable at the time the penal offence was committed.
